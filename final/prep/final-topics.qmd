**README:** The final exam will cover the following topics.

I will also assume you understand the material from the midterm.

As with the midterm, you do not need to memorize proofs. Understand the steps/reasoning. Intuition is paramount. I might ask how you get from one step to the next. I won't ask you to write down a full proof.

## Slide Set 7: Time Series

-   Notation
-   Assumptions
-   Static models
-   Dynamic models
    -   With lagged explanatory variables
    -   Autoregressive, distributed lag (ADL) models
    -   ADL(p,q)
    -   Long-run vs. short-run effects
-   Contemporaenous exogeneity

## Slide Set 8: Autocorrelation

-   Definition of autocorrelation
-   Negative and positive autocorrelation
-   Equation/formula for AR(p) processes
-   OLS implications for static models and dynamic models with lagged explanatory variables
-   OLS implications/bias for dynamic models with lagged dependent variables
-   Breusch-Godfrey test
    -   Hypotheses
    -   Interpretation of results
    -   Conclusion
-   Misspecification
-   FGLS: General idea

## Slide Set 9: Non-Stationary Time Series

-   Definition/requirements of nonstationarity
    -   Mean
    -   Variance
    -   Covariance
-   Random walks
-   Spurious correlations
-   Differencing

## Slide Set 10: Causality

-   Prediction vs. causal inference/estimation
-   Correlation vs. causation
-   Reverse causality
-   Experiments/RCTs
-   The "ideal experiment" (ideal dataset)
-   Treatment effects:
    -   Individual effects
    -   Average treatment effects
    -   Constant treatment effects
-   Selection bias

## Slide Set 11: Instrumental Variables

-   Exogeneity and endogeneity
-   Requirements for a valid instrument
    -   Relevant
    -   Exogenous
-   Probability limit
-   First stage and reduced form
-   Two-stage least squares
    -   Motivation
    -   First stage
    -   Second stage
-   Interpretation

## Slide Set 12: Prediction and Machine Learning

- Prediction goals/differences
- Why not OLS?
- Supervised *vs.* unsupervised
- Reducible *vs.* irreducible errors
- Training *vs.* testing
- MSE, L1, and L2
